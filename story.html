      <h3>How We Met</h3>
      <section id="padres">
      </section>
      <h4>As much as we both wish we could say we met in person and our eyes locked on the beach, that is simply not the
         case. Instead, we both swiped right. This started a few weeks of talking before Anthony's joke about going to
         sushi one night ended up with Sarah saying "bet" and meeting for sushi that night. After that there were
         many late nights talking and enough dates to have people asking if we were ever going to get tired of spending
         that much time together. Spoiler alert, we never did.</h4>
      <h3>Let the Adventures Begin</h3>
      <section id="niagra">
      </section>
      <h4>After we started dating the adventures truly began. We bonded over our love of food, the San Diego Padres,
         being outdoors, and binging random TV shows. Over the next 3.5 years we shared in many
         ups, downs, and changes. Including 1 graduation, 7 job changes, 6 moves, and 1 new family member our furbaby
         Beau. Throughout
         all of this chaos there has always been one constant, our love for each other.</h4>
      <h3>How we got Engaged</h3>
      <section id="engaged">
      </section>
      <h4>After almost 3 years of dating, the time had finally come. Anthony knew it was always going to be memorial day
         weekend, although he would never let Sarah believe that. Instead he spent many months taunting her that she
         would have to wait till after his cousings wedding that coming July. However, he had always heard how special
         that weekend and Idyllwild is to Sarah, so he knew it was the perfect place to pop the question. After a
         weekend filled with memories and family, Anthony took Sarah for a walk on Strawberry creek and the rest is
         history.</h4>
