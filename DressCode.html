      <h3>
         Semi Formal
      </h3>
      <h4>
         Our wedding will be a semi-formal affair, and we'd love for you to dress accordingly. Since both the ceremony
         and reception will take place outdoors, and it may be chilly, we recommend wearing long sleeves and long
         dresses or other attire (including jackets) that will keep you comfortable. There will be heaters at the
         reception to keep things cozy. Your warmth and presence are all that matter to us!
