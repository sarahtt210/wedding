      <h4>
         The weather here is vary variable but can get chilly in the evening. We are expecting it to be a little chilly out during the day as well so we are recommending longer dresses and longsleeve shirts. The ceremony is outdoors and the reception is outside with plenty of heaters, please dress accordingly.
