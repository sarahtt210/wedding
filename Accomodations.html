         We’re thrilled to let you know that we’ve arranged a hotel block for the wedding at SpringHill Suites
         Flagstaff! The rate is $209 per night, and each room can accommodate up to 5 adults, with breakfast included.

         While staying at this hotel is not required, it’s a convenient option for those who are interested. If you’d
         like to book using this special rate, please follow the link below:

         If you decide not to stay in a hotel, there are plenty of Airbnb and Vrbo options available in the area. We
         recommend choosing accommodations in the Mountainaire area or downtown Flagstaff.
